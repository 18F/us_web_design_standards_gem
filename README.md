# [`us_web_design_standards`](https://rubygems.org/gems/us_web_design_standards): U.S. Web Design Standards style assets gem

Provides the style assets from the [U.S. Web Design
Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) as a [Ruby
Gem](https://rubygems.org/).

Provides plugins for use with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based web sites.
Other frameworks may be supported in the future.

## Usage

This gem is compatible with both Jekyll and Rails.

### Jekyll

In your [`Gemfile`](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html), include the following:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'us_web_design_standards'
end
```

Add a `uswds.scss` file to your project in the asset directory of your
choosing that contains at least the following:

```scss
---
---

@import "us_web_design_standards";
```

Integrate the generated `uswds.css` file and its styles into your project's
layouts and templates, build the site per usual, and observe the results.

### Rails

In your [`Gemfile`](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html), include the following:

```ruby
gem 'us_web_design_standards'
```

In your `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`, add the following:

```
@import "us_web_design_standards";
@import "us_web_design_standards_fonts";
```

In your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`, add the following:

```
/*
 * = require vendor/jquery-1.11.3.min.js
 * = require components.js
 */
```

_Note: Image links currently don't work. We'll work with
18F/web-design-standards on a solution for this._

## Development

First, choose a Jekyll site you'd like to use to view the impact of your
updates and clone its repository; then clone this repository into the same
parent directory. For example, to use the 18F Guides Template:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/guides-template.git
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/us_web_design_standards_gem.git
```

In the `Gemfile` of the Jekyll site's repository, include the following:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'us_web_design_standards_gem', :path => '../us_web_design_standards_gem'
end
```
